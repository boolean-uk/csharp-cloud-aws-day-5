# Project Guide

## Setup
1. Creating a backend
   - Open up git bash in this folder and write:
    ```bash
    mkdir Backend
    ```
   - Then run the following commands in the Backend directory:
   ```bash
   dotnet new sln --name backend
   ```
   ```bash
   dotnet new webapi --name backend.wwwapi
   ```
   ```bash
   dotnet sln add **/*.csproj
   ```

2. Creating a frontend
   - Go back to the root directory and write this in git bash:
    ```bash
    mkdir Frontend
    ```
    - Then run the following command in the Frontend directory:
    ```bash
    npm create vite@latest frontend -- --template react
    ```
    - Then run the following command in the frontend directory:
    ```
    npm install
    ```

Now both the skeleton for the backend and frontend should be set up.

3. Creating an RDS Database
   - Navigate to [RDS Database](https://eu-north-1.console.aws.amazon.com/rds/home?region=eu-north-1#databases:)
   - Click `Create database` (All options not mentioned should be left the same as they are)
   - Engine options:
     - Select `PostgreSQL`
   - Templates:
     - Select `Free tier`
   - Settings:
     - Change the name of `DB instance identifier` (e.g `{name}-database`)
     - Set a `Master password`. Remember this!
   - Instance configuration:
     - Change `db.t4g.micro` to `db.t3.micro`
   - Connectivity:
     - Set `Public access` to `Yes`
   - Monitoring:
     - Uncheck `Turn on Performance Insights`
   - Click `Create database`
   - In the newly created database. Note down `{Endpoint} & {port}` in the `Connectivity & security` section!

4. Connecting the RDS database to your backend
   - In your backend, open `appsettings.json` and add this line under `"AllowedHosts": "*"`:
   ```bash
   "ConnectionStrings": {
    "DefaultConnection": "Host={Endpoint};Port={port};Database={name}-database;User Id=postgres;Password={Master password}"
    }
   ```
   - Now when your backend code is completed you can run these commands in Visual Studio's `Package Manager Console`:
   ```bash
   add-migration First
   ```
   ```bash
   update-database
   ```
   - If everything was set up correctly you should now be able to connect to your database with `TablePlus` or `Beekeeper` and see that your `DbSet` items in your DbContext are tables in the database.

5. Zip the backend
   - Navigate to your folder `backend.wwwapi` in git bash and run this command:
   ```bash
   dotnet publish -c Release -o out
   ```
   - Go to the `out` folder in File Explorer
   - Select all files
     - `Compress to...`
       - `ZIP`
   - Name it `backend.zip`

6. Deploy your Backend API
   - Navigate to  [Elastic Beanstalk](https://eu-north-1.console.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/home?region=eu-north-1#/applications)
   - Click `Create application`

    -----------------------------
   - Scroll down all the way and Click `Submit`
   - Now just wait for the Backend to Deploy!
   - Note down your environments `Domain`

7. Prepare the Frontend
   - Create a .env file in your frontend that contains:
   ```bash
   VITE_ENDPOINT_URL=http://{Domain}
   ``` 
   - Make sure the above url ends with `.com` and not `.com/`
   - Finish writing the code of the frontend that links to your backend.
   - Run this command to build the frontend:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

## Introduction
Backend + Frontend Cat App Where users can add new cats to the list of cats and then update the rating for each cat or delete them.

The backend is written in C# and Deployed using RDS Database + Elastic Beanstalk.

The frontend is written in React (jsx) and Deployed using Elastic Beanstalk Environment + S3 Bucket.

## Technical Designs
### Backend
The backend can be run using Swagger where you can GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE cat models that are being stored on the RDS Database.

Endpoints are the following:

   - [Root: /](http://joaquin-backend-env.eba-pirw2qwp.eu-north-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/) Returns `"Working"` if the API is up and running.
   - [GET: /cats](http://joaquin-backend-env.eba-pirw2qwp.eu-north-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/cats) Retrieves a list of all cats.
   - [POST: /cats](http://joaquin-backend-env.eba-pirw2qwp.eu-north-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/cats) Adds a new cat to the database.
   - [PUT: /cats{id}](http://joaquin-backend-env.eba-pirw2qwp.eu-north-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/cats) Updates the rating of an existing cat found on the given `{id}`.
   - [DELETE: /cats{id}](http://joaquin-backend-env.eba-pirw2qwp.eu-north-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/cats) Deletes an existing cat found on the given `{id}`.

### Frontend
The frontend can be run using Vite where you can use the UI elements to:
   - Create a new cat.
   - See all the current cats listed.
   - Update their rating.
   - Delete an individual cat from the list.

This frontend can also be accessed from this [S3 Bucket](http://joaquin-bucket.s3-website.eu-north-1.amazonaws.com/) (but only until it is wiped from AWS).

## Technical Descriptions
### Backend
The backend of the application is built using ASP.NET Core and provides a RESTful API with endpoints for managing cat models. It is deployed on AWS using Elastic Beanstalk, which handles the application environment and deployment. The backend interacts with an RDS PostgreSQL database to store and manage cat models. `CatContext` in the backend uses Entity Framework Core and `appsettings` Connection String to communicate and do operations on the RDS database.

### Database
The database includes a table for storing cat models with fields such as `id`, `name`, `age`, and `rating`. The database operations are managed by `CatContext`.

### Frontend
The frontend is a UI built with React, providing a user-friendly way to interact with the backend API. It displays two input boxes for a cat's name and age together with a create button to add a new cat to the list. It also displays a list of all cats currently in the database where users can increment or decrement the ratings of each cat and also delete a cat from the list. The frontend dynamically updates graphical elements to reflect changes in the database, creating a responsive and interactive UI. It is deployed on AWS using an S3 bucket configured to host a static website, and it accesses the backend API hosted on Elastic Beanstalk to update the database.

### Deployment Architecture
   - Backend: Deployed on AWS Elastic Beanstalk, connected to an RDS PostgreSQL database.
   - Frontend: Deployed on AWS S3, accessing the backend API on Elastic Beanstalk.
