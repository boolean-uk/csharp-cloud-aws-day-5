# Project Guide

## Setup

I had already installed all necesarry resources for this task, due to using it on previous exercises.

## Project overview

I used my previosly created RDS database, with beanstalk backend and S3 bucket frontend. I used the guide from cloud-day1 as a guide for setting up and creating the necesary resources. I used the TODO api on beanstalk and migrated the database.

## Technical Designs

No design choices were made during this project, due to using already existing projects.

## Technical Descriptions

I used the TODO app, and built ran npm build on the frontend app and set up the s3 bucket with dist files.
